# iterioc
WIP

for the kaggle rps contest.

Needs an agent with functions tweeze and ag defined, the former adjusts the agents' history based on the final choice, and the latter to return a move given obs and conf.

iterioc(n) will initialize n metalayers, and when ag is called it will provide an array of n values as answers for all the iteriocs up to n. Integratable in an MAB architecture
